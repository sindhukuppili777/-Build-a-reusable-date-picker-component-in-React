# Recurring Date Picker Component

This project is a reusable date picker component built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand. The component allows users to select recurring dates with customizable patterns, including daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly recurrence. It also provides a mini calendar preview of the selected recurring dates.

## Features

- **Recurrence Options**: Choose from daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly recurrence.
- **Customization**: Fine-tune recurrence by specifying intervals (e.g., every X days or weeks) and specific days of the week or month.
- **Date Range**: Set start and (optional) end dates for the recurrence.
- **Preview Calendar**: Visualize the recurring dates in a mini calendar.
- **State Management**: Uses Zustand to manage recurrence state globally.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive layout.

Components
DatePicker: A date picker for selecting start and (optional) end dates.
RecurrencePattern: Dropdown for choosing daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly recurrence.
MiniCalendar: Preview of recurring dates based on user-selected options.
State Management
This project uses Zustand for state management. The state is stored in the recurrenceStore.ts file, which manages the recurrence pattern, start date, end date, and customization options.

Usage
Select a start date using the date picker.
Choose a recurrence pattern (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly) from the dropdown.
Fine-tune the recurrence (e.g., every X days or specific days of the week).
Optionally, select an end date.
The mini calendar will display the recurring dates based on the selected pattern and options.
Testing
This project uses Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing.

To run the tests, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run test
Example Test
Here's an example of a unit test for the RecurrencePattern component:

js
Copy code
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import RecurrencePattern from '../components/RecurrencePattern';

test('recurrence pattern change updates state', () => {
  const { getByLabelText } = render(<RecurrencePattern />);
  const selectElement = getByLabelText('Recurrence Pattern');
  fireEvent.change(selectElement, { target: { value: 'weekly' } });
  expect(selectElement.value).toBe('weekly');
});
Technologies Used
Next.js: Framework for server-side rendering and React.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
Zustand: Simple and scalable state management library for React.
